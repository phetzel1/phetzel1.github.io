<p>Feel free to navigate through the links on this page to view some of the projects that I'm working on.  These projects are being actively developed as I learn more about data science!</p>

<p>One of the beneficial aspects of living in the present is the abundance of open data.  In particular, I typically set my sights on government-provided open data because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There's a lot of it.</p></li>
<li><p>It's usually messy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I use these data sets to both learn more about how to shape/visualize data and because I have a genuine interest for money in politics.</p>

</h4>

<p>In this project I am attempting to solve three different questions through public FEC filings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which companies give the most money over time?</li>
<li>Which political direction companies are likely to donate?</li>
<li>Which candidates are receiving the most money over time?</li>
</ul>

<p>The data comes in pipe-delimited files and is updated frequently.</p>

</h4>

<p>By law, lobbying disclosures must be made on a quarterly basis.  I have two questions for this project:</p>

<ul>
<li>What entities lobby the hardest?</li>
<li>What issues are lobbied the hardest?</li>
</ul>

<p>The data comes in XML format, which has allowed me to become familiar with the XPath querying language.</p>

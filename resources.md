## Resources for R

###[Try R: Code School](http://tryr.codeschool.com/)

This was the first step in my R adventure.  Very easy to navigate training to dip your toe into R.  Uses interactive examples to teach you the absolute basics

###[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)

One of the finest Interactive Development Environments (IDEs) for any coding language, RStudio makes it extremely easy to start and continue coding in R.

###[Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1)

Several free courses teaching the very basics of R all the way through visualization and modeling.  The courses begin on the first of every month and are taught via recorded video.

###[dplyr Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SGif63VW6E)

A tutorial on the dplyr package from its creator, Hadley Wickham.  dplyr is an oustanding way to transform and aggregate data.  Mr. Wickham is also the creator of popular R packages ggplot2, ggvis, tidr, and several others.

##Resources for python

###[Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)

The best way to get started with analytics-driven python is to download the Anaconda distribution.  This also comes with the excellent Spyder IDE, which is very similar to RStudio.  Additionally, Anaconda includes the Jupyter Notebook package, which has become standard for python demonstrations.

###[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)

Wes McKinney's pandas library is the standard for data analysis in python.  The library allows for a tabular view of the data (through the DataFrame structure), along with the ability to quickly reshape data.

###[Sci-kit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

Sci-kit Learn is a renowned machine-learning library for python.  The individuals that continue to develop this library have done an outstanding job of covering popular statistical tests and models.

##Miscellaneous Resources

###[Hyde Blog Theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde)

This is the link to the theme I'm using, which was created by Mark Otto.  The blog itself is powered by the Jekyll static site generator.

###[Database Joins](http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/)

Typically in a problem involving data, it's very beneficial to know the basics behind database joins.  I've found learning the different types of joins through pictures of Venn Diagrams to be the most helpful.

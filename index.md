##Welcome to my Website!

Thank you for visiting my personal website!  I've made this website for a couple of reasons, the most important of which is to help others attempting to learn data science on their way.  I started down the data science learning path about a year ago, so it is my hope that I can help others learn from some mistakes that I've made.  I'll also showcase a select group of my projects, so beginners have an idea of what the data science process looks like.

So with that being said, go explore!  If you cannot find what you are looking for, I have also linked some resources that have helped me along my way.

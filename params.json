These projects are being actively developed as I learn more about data science!\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nOne of the beneficial aspects of living in the present is the abundance of open data.  In particular, I typically set my sights on government-provided open data because:\r\n\r\n1. There's a lot of it.\r\n\r\n2. It's usually messy.\r\n\r\nI use these data sets to both learn more about how to shape/visualize data and because I have a genuine interest for money in politics.\r\n\r\n#### [Federal Election Commission Data](http://phetzel1.github.io/Election_Data)\r\nIn this project I am attempting to solve three different questions through public FEC filings:\r\n- Which companies give the most money over time?\r\n- Which political direction companies are likely to donate?\r\n- Which candidates are receiving the most money over time?\r\n\r\nThe data comes in pipe-delimited files and is updated frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### [Lobbying Disclosure Data](http://phetzel1.github.io/Lobbying/)\r\nBy law, lobbying disclosures must be made on a quarterly basis.  I have two questions for this project:\r\n- What entities lobby the hardest?\r\n- What issues are lobbied the hardest?\r\n\r\nThe data comes in XML format, which has allowed me to become familiar with the XPath querying language.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

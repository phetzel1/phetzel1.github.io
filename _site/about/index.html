  <h2>The Author</h2>

<p>As the giant heading to the left suggests, my name is Phillip Hetzel.  I am currently a government consultant based out of Washington, D.C.  Here are some quick facts about me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Favorite Sports Teams: Chelsea FC, University of Maryland Basketball</li>
<li>Favorite U.S. City to Visit: Austin, TX</li>
<li>Guilty Pleasure Movie: Top Gun</li>
<li>Hobbies: Coding, Hiking, Fishing</li>
</ul>

<p>I mainly program in R and enjoy working with datasets dealing with money in politics.  I am also in the process of learning python, with a specific focus on analytical coding.</p>

<h2>Why did I make this site?</h2>

<p>This website was born out of curiousity more than anything.  I ran across the GitHub user site for an R language idol, <a href="http://ramnathv.github.io/">Ramnath Vaidyanathan</a>, and saw that it was an efficient way to store many types of information. So I dove into the world of web development and found it to be one of the most trying coding exercises I&#39;ve ever performed.  However now that the page is operational, I am happy that I didn&#39;t quit when I realized how little I knew about HTML/CSS/Jekyll/etc.</p>

<p>A more valuable reason for this site is to supply knowledge and resources for Data Science &quot;newbies,&quot; as I was months ago.  In the beginning of my journey, I struggled greatly.  I had performed a bit of coding here and there in college, but nothing similar to analytics-driven coding.  Every time I felt like I hit a brick wall, I would scour the Internet until I could find an answer.  I probably spent more time on Stack Overflow than I spent coding when I had just began.</p>

<p>Therefore, my hope is that this website would be able to give a novice coder an extra push in the right direction.  Please enjoy this website, and feel free to contact me with any questions!  </p>

<p>-Phil</p>

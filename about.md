##The Author

As the giant heading to the left suggests, my name is Phillip Hetzel.  I am currently a government consultant based out of Washington, D.C.  Here are some quick facts about me:

* Favorite Sports Teams: Chelsea FC, University of Maryland Basketball
* Favorite U.S. City to Visit: Austin, TX
* Guilty Pleasure Movie: Top Gun
* Hobbies: Coding, Hiking, Fishing

I mainly program in R and enjoy working with datasets dealing with money in politics.  I am also in the process of learning python, with a specific focus on analytical coding.

##Why did I make this site?

This website was born out of curiousity more than anything.  I ran across the GitHub user site for an R language idol, [Ramnath Vaidyanathan](http://ramnathv.github.io/), and saw that it was an efficient way to store many types of information. So I dove into the world of web development and found it to be one of the most trying coding exercises I've ever performed.  However now that the page is operational, I am happy that I didn't quit when I realized how little I knew about HTML/CSS/Jekyll/etc.

A more valuable reason for this site is to supply knowledge and resources for Data Science "newbies," as I was months ago.  In the beginning of my journey, I struggled greatly.  I had performed a bit of coding here and there in college, but nothing similar to analytics-driven coding.  Every time I felt like I hit a brick wall, I would scour the Internet until I could find an answer.  I probably spent more time on Stack Overflow than I spent coding when I had just began.

Therefore, my hope is that this website would be able to give a novice coder an extra push in the right direction.  Please enjoy this website, and feel free to contact me with any questions!  

-Phil
